# Getting Started with Tensor Flow - Object Detection

To start, ensure you have a webcam. If you dont, I suggest you try and use DroidCam from https://www.dev47apps.com/.
PS: To use DroidCam, you need to install on both pc and mobile. After installation, connect the pc client using the ip and port from the mobile app. Do test if your browser detects DroidCam as a webcam after.

If your webcam is set and ready, proceed.

1. Clone this repo if you haven't yet.
2. Open terminal and do "npm install" or "npm i"
3. After installing dependencies, I suggest you ignore the library vulnerabilities for now and try to tun with "npm start"
4. It should open a tab in your browser showing the camera view.
5. You can look in the console for logs of objects detected.
